# Gofer: The journey so far

Oasys Gofer is already one year old! As we celebrate this first birthday, we’re feeling nostalgic about the journey so far.

The Gofer team is made up of members from 15 offices in 6 countries, all of whom worked for three years in collaboration to develop Gofer. We wanted to respond to industry changes and ever growing needs to collaborate and work remotely while taking advantage of cloud computing capabilities.

We knew that with the expertise of Arup geotechnical engineers and Oasys developers, we could create a solution that made the everyday easier with a user-friendly tool that reimagined FEA (finite element analysis).

Starting from this base of knowledge and expertise, we set the ambitious task to unearth innovations in geotechnics modelling. We were inspired by the gopher, our furry underground-dwelling friend that creates tunnels for its home while also making soil more fertile and facilitating root networks from above. What a wonderful metaphor for geotechnical analysis creating new possibilities above ground, by investigating and exploring the ground below!

With these ideas in mind, we began sculpting our own Gofer. Starting with the soil blocks, we built up capabilities for c-phi and steady state seepage analysis, the ability to draw structures and apply loads, adding in intricacies of pins and springs. We also added the ability to specify materials and conditions such as Linear Elastic and Mohr-Coulomb parameters. We’re currently adding the finishing touches to structural interfaces and consolidation, two additions to boost Gofer’s capabilities.

The features were key to answering industry needs, but the interface is one of our proudest achievements! Looking back on the earliest designs, it is easy to see we have come a long way in Gofer’s evolution. With each new revision Gofer became even easier to learn and use.

Being web-based, Gofer enables all of that functionality to be used from anywhere you have an internet connection. You can share across different systems and platforms; all you need is the license. Just like our busy animal namesake, we wanted to support work on the ground, with all project partners.

The journey is far from over, Gofer continues to grow and expand its capabilities and with that more and more networks and outputs become possible.
