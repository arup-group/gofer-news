# Let Gofer be your guide

![Gofer is your guide](https://b2c-templates-arup.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/gofer/Getting_started_image.svg)

Welcome to the Oasys Gofer experience! We’ve reimagined geotechnical finite element analysis (FEA) and created a tool that is incredibly user friendly. Bring the benefits of cloud-computing to your models, with access from wherever you have an internet connection, without the need for a powerful machine.

We’ve made it easy to get started, let Gofer be your guide! In this article we dig in and explore the key elements of the modelling process.

It all starts with the model! For your first time delving into Gofer it’s a good idea to start from the ground up by creating your own model. Click on **New model** to start the process. The model wizard will open. From there you can name your model and determine the dimensions as well as the number of soil blocks. This will give you a basic set up from which you can investigate all the key elements according to everyday engineering situations.

Of course, you can always upload your own model, clone a model that has been shared with you, or use one of our example models as your foundation.

Gofer’s tools are grouped in sequential elements, to which properties and conditions can be applied by drawing, connecting, or defining them. Let’s take a look at these tool groupings.

## Soil blocks and nodes

Whether you start with ready ready-made soil blocks, creating soil layers in the model set up, or by drawing your own using the nodes and drawing tools, soil blocks come next.

All soils in Gofer are represented as blocks in a closed shape. These can be drawn anywhere on the grid using a **Free form** or **Rectangle** tool. You can further edit and divide or merge blocks together using the **Nodes, Splitting blocks** or **Merging blocks** tools. Slice a block into soil zones or add loads to the edges of the blocks.

## Structures and loads

Structures are drawn as lines within the soil blocks using one of the existing nodes or edges. Drawing **Pins** and adding **Rotational springs** as well as **Props** or **Node links** are a suite of tools within Gofer you can use to draw the elements you would like to include in your model.

## Materials

Now that your soil blocks and structures are drawn, it is time to define the soil materials. For this, use the **Materials** tab in the **Properties panel**. You can set up your own parameters and / or use Linear Elastic and Mohr Coulomb constitutive models.

Having defined the parameters of the soil, materials and structures, you will be ready to enter the **Configuration** stage. Use your model to configure your construction stages and represent your construction sequence. In this section you can assign materials and groundwater profiles to soils, turn soil blocks and loads on and off, and run more than one scenario on the same data to see sequential stages.

## Results

When you are happy with the configurations and assignments, the **Results** tab lets you run your analysis and then view the results. Navigate the results using the controls to select variables and outputs. Adjust the outputs using the controls in the **Properties panel**. View and export structural results graphs to see what Gofer has unearthed!

Much like our furry namesake, Gofer supports collaboration that can make working across networks possible. You can also share your model with any licensed user.
