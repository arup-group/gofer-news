On 17th October we delivered our webinar **Level Up Your FEA With Oasys Gofer: Consolidation and real-world applications**. Presented by our very own **Matthew Brown**, Senior Geotechnical Engineer and **Samila Bandara**, Senior Computational Scientist, the team dug into the latest capabilities, demonstrate benchmarking examples, and discussed the potentials of the User API to inspire you.

## What’s new?  

Gofer now offers **increased algorithm efficiency** and **more computing power** to elevate your routine geotechnical Finite Element Analysis.  We’ve added a fully implicit consolidation solver, enabling the dissipation of excess pore water pressures to be modelled together with corresponding long-term ground movements. This allows for a more complete and accurate representation of many geotechnical problems to be modelled in Gofer. Improvements to the way undrained soils are represented in Gofer mean **better handling of complex geotechnical problems**. With further algorithm enhancements and improvements to interface elements Gofer is now more robust and numerically stable than ever.   

Performance has been improved. For faster and more effective analysis we’ve implemented a Sloan acceleration scheme. We have also made efficiency improvements in the numerical tolerances meaning accurate solutions are achieved faster.     

Gofer’s **robust API supports automation**, allowing Gofer to be controlled using Python. The team presented examples of sensitivity analyses demonstrating the automation potential of being in the cloud. It is easy to integrate into your existing workflows to enhance productivity and simplify routine geotechnical FEA making every day modelling efficient. 

Designed for geotechnical engineers of all experience levels, Gofer is user-friendly and accelerates skill development with readily available tutorials, example models, and updated documentation.
