# A postcard from NUMGE

As autumn begins, we're looking back on a summer of creativity, conversations, and - in the UK at least - occasionally questionable weather. This summer, Oasys Gofer has been out and about on a very special adventure, the 10th European conference on Numerical Methods in Geotechnical Engineering (NUMGE). This was the first event sponsored by Oasys Gofer and the team met students, academics, and industry professionals at the conference, held at Imperial College, London.

Bringing together engineering practitioners, researchers, and students from across Europe, this event was a springboard for three days of discussions on state-of-the-art numerical methods and highly anticipated developments in geotechnical engineering.

Oasys Senior Business Development Manager, Norbert Kovacs; Head of Oasys Geotechnical Software, Carol Matthews; and Head of Computational Science, Ramaseshan Kannan, were delighted to meet excited visitors at the Oasys Gofer stand to meet some of the people behind the product.

There was a lot of enthusiasm for Gofer’s cloud-based capabilities, and the potential for other innovations along the journey to cloud. Gofer’s clean design and intuitive interface were also singled out, with universities commenting on its potential as a finite element analysis (FEA) learning tool.

With the start of a new term, our next generation geotechnical analysis software is ready to guide the future cohort of geotechnical engineers.
