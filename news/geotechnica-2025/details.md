We’re excited to be exhibiting at [**Geotechnica**](https://www.equipegroup.com/geotechnica/about) 2025 as **Silver Sponsors** at Warwickshire Event Centre. It’s a fantastic opportunity to connect with other exhibitors and attendees, exchange insights, and strengthen relationships across the geotechnical community.  

We want to meet you, our colleagues from across the geotechnical engineering industry, and share with you the latest from our [**Oasys Geotechnical product portfolio**](https://www.oasys-software.com/products/geotechnical-suite/), including updates to **Oasys Giraphe** and **Oasys Gofer**.

We think you’ll be excited too when you see how these tools are helping engineers solve everyday ground engineering challenges more efficiently.
