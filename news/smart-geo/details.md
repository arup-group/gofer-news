The Oasys team is exhibiting again at the second Smart Geotechnic Conference in London on the 5th of October! We’re excited meet with you, learn from you, and share with you. And we’ll be joined by new friends!

Phil Child, Senior Consultant for Geotechnical Information Management at Seequent will help us introduce our latest product offering, Oasys Giraphe. This is our first product developed as a Seequent Technology Partner. We think you will be as excited as we are to welcome Giraphe to the Oasys portfolio.

You may have already met the Oasys Gofer team at NUMGE earlier this year. In addition to Gofer, our reimagined FEA (finite element analysis) modelling solution, Giraphe is a new graphing tool for use with OpenGround.

With Giraphe you can create a range of graphs to construct in situ and laboratory testing results and geo-environmental and monitoring data. Seamlessly connect to OpenGround datasets, or create your own by uploading a CSV and produce report-ready graphs in a few clicks.

Come and visit our booth. We are looking forward to introducing you to our latest addition to the Oasys geotechnical suite of products with Smart Geotechnic Basements and Underground Structures conference attendees.
