The Oasys team exhibited again at the second Smart Geotechnic Conference in London on the 5th of October! There was lots of excitment on all sides. We got to meet with you, learn from you, and share with you. And lots of interest for our new friends and product.


Phil Child, Senior Consultant for Geotechnical Information Management at Seequent helped us introduce our latest product offering, Oasys Giraphe. This is our first product developed as a Seequent Technology Partner. We were glad to hear so much interest and enthusiasm from you as we welcome Giraphe to the Oasys portfolio.

You may have already met the Oasys Gofer team at NUMGEu earlier this year. In addition to Gofer, our reimagined FEA (finite element analysis) modelling solution, Giraphe is a new graphing tool for use with OpenGround.

With Giraphe you can create a range of graphs to construct in situ and laboratory testing results and geo-environmental and monitoring data. Seamlessly connect to OpenGround datasets, or create your own by uploading a CSV and produce report-ready graphs in a few clicks.

It was great to have so many visitors at our booth. We're so glad we were able to introduce you to our latest addition to the Oasys geotechnical suite of products at Smart Geotechnic Basements and Underground Structures conferences.
