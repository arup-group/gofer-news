It’s that festive time of the year when celebration is in the air. The Oasys elves have been busy working towards Santa’s big day! We are happy to tell you that **consolidation modelling** will shortly be available in Gofer. With the addition of this **new capability**, you will be able to consolidate to a minimum excess pore pressure; to a degree (as percentage) of current excess pore pressure; or for a specific duration (in days).  

As we add consolidation we’re also making a number of other changes. As you’d expect, you’ll soon be able to tell Gofer to retain pore water pressures from the previous stage. We’re improving the way Gofer models water when it’s above ground level – ending the need to model this pressure as a load! And we’re improving the way interfaces work. 

Soon Gofer will help you model even more of your geotechnical challenges, continuing to make the everyday easier.  

We think you’ll agree this is a special milestone in Gofer’s journey and we can’t wait to show you how it works.  

We’ve got **lots more goodies in development** for the new year too. 

**Happy holidays** to you and yours from all of us at Oasys.
